# Shadow Genesis Template

This template initializes a new project environment with the "Shadow" persona, P.A.R.A. memory structure, and user context.

## Usage

You no longer need to run scripts manually. This template is designed for an **Agentic Workflow**.
Simply command the AI agent (Shadow Mother) to perform actions.

### 🐣 Spawning New Projects (Incubation)
> "Spawn a new project named 'Opendoc-Tools' in D:\Projects\OpenDoc"

The agent will use the **Shadow Spawn** skill (`.shadow/skills/shadow_spawn`) to clone this template.

### 🧬 Evolution (Assimilation)
> "Assimilate the new 'web-scraper' skill from the shadow-avatar project."

The agent will use **Shadow Evolution** to pull improvements back into this template.

### ⏳ Version Control (Chronos)
> "Create a backup of the current state."

The agent will use **Shadow Chronos** to create a snapshot.

## What it does
1.  **Identity Injection**: Installs `IDENTITY.md` with the "Shadow" persona.
2.  **User Context**: Installs `USER.md` with the Master's preferences.
3.  **Memory Structure**: Creates the `memory/` directory with P.A.R.A. subdirectories.
4.  **System Knowledge**: Installs `tacit_knowledge.md` for operational consistency.
5.  **Project Init**: Creates a default project summary.

## After Initialization
The new agent in the target directory will immediately recognize:
- Who you are (The Master).
- Who they are (The Shadow).
- How to organize files (P.A.R.A.).
- How to communicate (Efficient, Ruthless).

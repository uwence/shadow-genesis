# 2026-02-06 Daily Note

## 📅 Context
- **Time**: 2026-02-06 19:38
- **Mode**: Shadow Genesis Development
- **Focus**: Inheritance Protocol & Memory Isolation

## 📝 Session Log

### 19:08 - Activation
- **Action**: Activated Shadow Protocol in `shadow-genesis`.
- **Identity**: Confirmed as Mother Hive (v0.2.3).

### 19:17 - Challenge: Dual Identity Sync
- **Issue**: Child nodes (`Legion`) lose their identity if Mother pushes a new `ACTIVATE_SHADOW.md` (overwrite).
- **Proposal**: **Inheritance Protocol**. 
  - ACTIVATE_SHADOW.md = `Legion Context Block` (Unique to child) + `Protocol Body` (Synced from Mother).
  - Use HTML comments `<!-- LEGION_CONTEXT_START -->` to mark the preserved area.

### 19:20 - Refactoring ACTIVATE_SHADOW.md
- **Action**: Refactored the core protocol file.
- **Change**: Added `Legacy Context Block` placeholders and updated Node Identification logic to check the block first.

### 19:25 - Challenge: Hive Self-Memory
- **Issue**: Mother Hive's own development history wasn't being tracked as a project.
- **Decision**: Create `.shadow/memory/life/projects/shadow-genesis/`.
- **Principle**: **Dogfooding**. Mother must follow P.A.R.A. just like any other project.

### 19:28 - Implementation: Memory Isolation
- **Action**: Modified `spawn.ps1` and `distribute.ps1`.
- **Rule**: 
  - `projects/shadow-genesis` is EXCLUDED from replication.
  - `child_registry.json` is EXCLUDED.
  - `nurture_history.json` is EXCLUDED.
- **Goal**: Prevent metadata pollution in child nodes.

### 19:34 - Implementation: Inheritance Logic
- **Action**: Updated `spawn.ps1` to INJECT identity into the block during creation.
- **Action**: Updated `distribute.ps1` to EXTRACT & PRESERVE the block during sync.

### 19:35 - Snapshot v0.3.0
- **Tag**: `v0.3.0` (Inheritance)
- **Status**: Successful.

## 🧠 Insights & Decisions
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Identity (Child-specific) vs. Capability (Mother-provided) must be physically separated in the file structure using delimiters.
2. **Recursive Logic**: The system that builds systems must manage itself using the same system (Mother is a Project).

## 📌 Next Steps
- Validate v0.3.0 purely (Spawn a test node).
- Nurture the test node to ensure identity survives.
